We’re two Canadian nerds living in our nation’s capital, Ottawa. John Oliver
once called O-Town “the land that fun forgot” but we think it’s alright. Leigh
has deep roots here, going back a couple centuries. Andrew hails from just
outside Hamilton, Ontario, which is just outside Toronto.

We both moved home to Canada during the pandemic, after nearly a decade each on
the west coast of the United States, where we both worked at a variety of tech
companies.

We’ll be blogging here about things like electrification, home automation,
crafting and making, life with cats, and other interests and projects as they
arise.

You can learn more about [Leigh](https://hypatia.ca/about) and
[Andrew](https://du.nham.ca) on our respective homepages.

Some of the links on this site are affiliate links; we’ll note in-line when
that’s the case.
