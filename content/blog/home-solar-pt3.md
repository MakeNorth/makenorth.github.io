This blog post is the third in a series about installing solar panels on our
house. In this post, we'll cover how we chose a solar installer to work with,
and how we decided on the system we wanted installed. We'll also cover the
basics of the various components of a solar system.

## Picking an Installer

### What Does an Installer Do?

Unless you decide to do a solar installation yourself, you're almost certainly
going to be working with a solar installer in your area. Typically, these are
companies (or rarely, individuals or partnerships) that handle the entire
process of notifying the Electrical Safety Authority ("permitting"), working
with the electrical utility in the area, and subcontracting out the work that
must be performed by an electrician, electrical engineer, or roofer. Depending
on the area and the installation, they may also be responsible for obtaining a
building permit from your local building department.

After the installation is complete and the solar system is commissioned, your
installer is almost always the party responsible for any warranties for the
installed system. Typically, the manufacturer of a component (inverter, solar
panel, battery, etc.) will have a manufacturer warranty, but the installer is
responsible for making the claim and performing any labour to
remove/repair/replace a failed component.

Finally, in most cases, the solar installer will also provide design
services–they'll take a look at your house or property and use their experience
and judgement to provide a recommendation for what size of system to install,
where to locate the panels, switches, inverter (and so on), and do some basic
modeling based on information you provide to give you some idea what your
return on investment will be. Though, as mentioned in
[part 1](@/blog/home-solar-pt1.md), take this with a grain of salt; some
installers are conservative with such estimates, and some are wildly
optimistic.

### What Do You Need?

As a homeowner, you should go into the discussions with any solar installer
with a pretty firm idea of what you want to accomplish with your solar
installation. Here's a set of questions that you should probably ask yourself
before getting any quotes, even if the answer to some of them is "we don't know
yet":

1. **What's the absolute upper limit of your budget?** This is by _far_ the
   most important question to ask yourselves. There is essentially no upper
   limit on the amount of money you can spend on a solar installation, so
   before getting any quotes, it's worth asking yourself how much money you can
   afford to spend, and how much you want to spend.
2. **Do you want solar to provide back-up power when the power goes out?** This
   question is an important second question to ask yourself, since it
   fundamentally changes what kind of system needs to be installed. Perhaps
   counterintuitively, many kinds of solar systems don't work when the power
   goes out–and those that do almost always require a battery to be installed
   to "smooth out" the variable nature of solar power.
3. **How much of your power bill are you hoping to recoup?** This is
   essentially the main question if you answer "no" to question #2; if you
   don't care about backup power, then your solar installation will be feeding
   power back into your main panel, with any excess going into the power grid.
   See below for more on how to think about this question.
4. **Do you have any space or location constraints?** For example, in our
   installation we decided to only install panels on one side of our roof,
   instead of both sides. We also had some space constraints outside our house
   for where we could put a disconnect switch and rapid shutdown, since there
   were windows in the way. In our utility room, we had a set of shelves that
   we needed to move and some other work that we needed to accomplish before
   the solar inverter could be hung on the wall.

   Knowing the answer to this question ahead of time will help your installer
   decide what kinds of equipment to install–for example, if you have no space
   in your utility room for a full-size solar inverter, perhaps they'd choose
   to install microinverters under each solar panel.

### How Do You Find An Installer?

We won't go into tons of details here, since this is essentially the same
question as finding any other kind of contractor. However, a few key points:

- Never go with someone that comes door-to-door without detailed vetting. These
  tend to be poor deals at best, and scams at worst.
- Don't lease a system; buy it outright, or obtain your own financing. Having a
  leased system on the roof of your house can make it _much_ harder to sell
  your house down the road.
- Get referrals from people you know, or people in your neighbourhood.
- Ask for references; we've acted as a reference for our solar installer before.
- Ask them what kinds and brands of systems they install, and then look for
  reviews of those names and models. For example, if the installer primarily
  installs a particular brand or model of inverter that is known to have
  problems or requires detailed troubleshooting, you may want to think twice.

### Thinking About Your Power Bill

When you're deciding on the size of solar system to install, you should think
about how much of your power bill you want to cover with solar. This topic is
heavily dependant on the situation at your house; how much sun you get, how
much shade you have and at what time of the year, how cloudy it tends to be in
your area, whether you have a lot of snow in the winter, and so on.
Nonetheless, a few general rules of thumb can be helpful:

- In our experience here in Ottawa, Ontario, solar panels stop contributing a
  meaningful amount to your power bill in the months of November through
  February. To put some numbers on it, here's the production numbers for our
  solar panels from November 2023 through March 2024:

  | Month    | Production (kWh) |
  |----------|------------------|
  | November | 226              |
  | December | 83.1             |
  | January  | 68.1             |
  | February | 351              |
  | March    | 914              |
  | April    | 1096             |
  | May      | 1437             |

  As you can see, in January, we produced less than 5% of the amount we
  produced in May!  Now, we also have trees in our backyard that shade the
  panels when the sun is low in the sky, but this is still a good rule of
  thumb.
- Think about how you're likely to change your electricity consumption in the
  future. Are you going to switch to an electric or heat-pump hot water heater?
  Are you going to buy an electric car? Are you going to install a heat pump
  for heating and cooling?
- In Ontario, you won't get paid if you backfeed more power to the power grid
  than you consume from it over the course of a year, so there's no (financial)
  point in installing a system that's larger than your annual consumption. In
  other areas, you may get paid for this excess power, so it may make sense to
  install a larger system. Note that this doesn't apply if you're installing an
  off-grid system, though, which is somewhat outside the scope of this blog
  series.
- Both Hydro Ottawa and Hydro One (and likely other electrical utilities) will
  let you download your historical power consumption data. This can be very
  helpful in determining how much power you use, and your solar installer will
  likely ask for this data as part of the design process.

### What We Did

We got quotes from a few local companies that we found through Google,
Facebook, and Reddit. We asked each of them to provide a quote for installing
solar given the constraints that we had (e.g. only installing solar panels on
the one side of our house). We spoke to them on the phone and got a feel for
how they worked, and how flexible they would be to meet our needs.

Partway through the process, Ottawa was hit with a [derecho][derecho], which
caused widespread destruction throughout Ottawa and other parts of Ontario. We
were without power for more than a week, and learned during the process that
our neighbourhood was at the bottom of the priority list for restoring power.
This was a big factor in our decision to install a battery system, which we'll
go over in more detail in a later post.

As a result, we went with an installer that was willing to provide a quote for
an all-in-one unit that worked with any brand of 48V battery, since being able
to install non-proprietary and cheaper batteries (for more storage per dollar)
and expand in the future was important to us. Due to some changes in the ESA
regulations for battery installations in homes, we decided to not include
batteries as part of the initial installation, but to install the inverter in
such a way that we could add batteries as a follow-on project.

## Choosing a System

Now that you know what you want to accomplish with your solar installation,
it's time to think about the *kind* of system that you want to install. There
are a few key components to a solar system, and a few key decisions to make
about each one.

### Solar Panels

In general, for _most_ people, the exact brand of solar panel that you install
does not matter. Your installer will likely have a preferred brand that they
install, and will be providing the warranty for the panels in any case. Unless
you're heavily constrained on roof space and want to get the most power out of
each panel, any residential solar panel will likely be fine. All that being
said, when your installer gives you the quote, it's worth double-checking the
basics:
1. Do the panels come with a warranty? Ideally, they should be warrantied to
   produce at least 80% of their rated power after 25 years.
2. Do the panels come from a brand with a good reputation? If you can find
   reviews of the manufacturer online, that's a good sign.
3. Are the aesthetics of the panels acceptable to you? Some panels have a black
   frame, and some have a silver frame. The shapes of the cells that make up
   the panels can vary, and some have a visible grid of wires on the front,
   some less so. If you're going to be looking at these panels for the next 25
   years, you should like how they look, or at least be okay with it.
4. Ensure that you have a copy of the panel's datasheet, which should include
   at least the panels rated power (both voltage and current), and the
   temperature coefficient of the panel. This will be important for checking
   the inverter's compatibility with the panels, which we'll cover in a later
   post.

### Inverters

The inverter is the component of the solar system that converts the DC power
from the solar panels into AC power that can be used in your house or fed back
into the power grid. There are a few different kinds of inverters, and each has
its own pros and cons.

#### Microinverters

Microinverters are small devices that fit behind each panel (or sometimes each
pair of panels). Microinverters have a few key advantages:
- They act as optimizers; since each panel is generating AC power independently
  of the others, the system is less sensitive to shading or other issues that
  might affect the output of a single panel.
- They have fewer single points of failure; if one microinverter fails, the
  rest of the system can continue to operate and generate power.
- They can be more space-efficient; if you have a small utility room and
  minimal outdoor wall space, you may not have the room for a full-size inverter.
- They're safer... probably. Microinverters are typically installed behind the
  solar panels, so there's no high-voltage DC power running through your house.
  This is a bit of a contentious topic, since modern string inverters include
  rapid shutdown systems that similarly cut off the high-voltage DC power in
  the event of a fire or other emergency, along with arc-fault and ground-fault
  detection systems.

However, they also have disadvantages:
- They don't integrate directly with any batteries; since the microinverters
  are generating AC power, they can't be used to charge a battery directly.
  Instead, if you have a battery setup, the battery will contain a separate
  bidirectional inverter that turns AC power from solar or the grid into DC
  power for the battery, and vice versa. This is less efficient than converting
  DC from the solar panels directly into DC for the battery. More on this below.
- They don't have "black start" capabilities. Typically, a microinverter won't
  start producing power until it sees a certain voltage on the grid, which
  means that if the power goes out, the microinverters won't start producing
  power until the grid comes back up. This can be a problem if you run your
  battery empty, for example.
- They're more proprietary. If you have a string inverter connected to certain
  kinds of battery (see below), you can typically replace it with another
  string inverter from a different manufacturer with minimal fuss.
  Microinverters are typically proprietary and only work with their own
  battery, control system, etc.

#### String Inverters

A "string inverter" is the term for an inverter that is connected to a long
"string" of solar panels. These inverters are typically mounted on a wall
outside your house or in your utility room. There are two kinds of string
inverters: string inverters that are solely inverters–i.e. only convert DC
power from the solar panels into AC power for the grid–and string inverters
that can also interoperable with batteries–sometimes called "all-in-one"
inverters.

They have a few key advantages:

- They're typically more efficient than microinverters. Since the inverter is
  converting power from many panels at once, it can be more efficient than
  many small inverters converting power from each panel. Additionally, the
  higher the voltage, the smaller size of wire needs to be run; since the
  inverter is converting power from many panels at once, the voltage is higher
  than with microinverters. See Appendix A below for a (very basic) example.
- They're typically less expensive than microinverters, though this typically
  only applies at the lower end of the market.
- They can be used to charge a battery directly, if you have one. This is
  because the inverter is converting DC power from the solar panels into AC
  power for the grid, and can be configured to charge a battery instead of
  feeding power back into the grid. DC-DC power conversion tends to be more
  efficient than DC-AC or AC-DC power conversion.
- They can "black start" a system. If the power goes out, a string inverter can
  start producing power as soon as the sun comes up, even if the grid is still
  down. This is because the inverter an power itself with power from the solar
  panels that are connected to it, and then start producing power to charge
  batteries or power your house.
- They can work with multiple types of batteries. Since the inverter is
  producing DC power, it can be used to charge a battery directly, and can be
  configured to work with many different kinds and brands of batteries.

However, they also have disadvantages:
- They're more sensitive to shading. If one panel in a string is shaded, the
  entire string will produce less power. This can be mitigated by using
  optimizers, which are similar to microinverters in that there's one connected
  to each panel in the system.
- They require a separate rapid shutdown system. Since the wires running from
  the solar array are typically high-voltage DC, there needs to be a way to cut
  off the power in the event of a fire or other emergency. This is typically
  done with a rapid shutdown system, which is a system that listens for a
  "heartbeat" from the inverter, and if none is detected, cuts off the power to
  the array. This can be a separate box that's mounted on the wall near the
  inverter, or it can be integrated into the inverter itself. Many rapid
  shutdown systems also offer optimization as an option.
- They're more of a single point of failure. If the inverter fails, the entire
  system will stop producing power. This can be mitigated by having a spare
  inverter on hand, splitting the array into multiple separate strings, or just
  having a good warranty on the inverter and using a brand with good
  availability of spare parts.

{% tip() %}
In addition to the above, there are two major sub-types of inverter:
low-frequency and high-frequency. Many people won't need to care about the
difference here, so feel free to skip this section if you're not interested.

A low-frequency inverter is a type of inverter that operates at a lower
"switching frequency" than a high-frequency inverter. Typically, these
inverters have massive transformers, in the form of a massive coil of wire,
that they use to convert from the battery voltage to AC power. This means that
the inverter is physically larger, heavier, and more expensive than a
high-frequency inverter. However, it also means that the inverter is typically
more reliable (since it has to switch less often) and can handle larger surges
of power due to the energy stored in the transformer.

Low-frequency inverters are the best kind of inverter for starting massive
motor loads; if you have a well pump or large air conditioner(s), a
low-frequency inverter will be a more reliable choice for starting those solely
off battery power. Common brands of low-frequency inverters include Outback,
Victron, and Schneider.

High-frequency inverters are substantially more common than low-frequency
inverters, since they're lighter, smaller, and more affordable. Most solar
inverters that do not integrate with batteries are high-frequency, for example.
These inverters tend to be more efficient than low-frequency inverters as well,
though this depends on the manufacturer. Most "all-in-one" inverters are
high-frequency, as are all microinverters.

Common brands of high-frequency inverters include SolarEdge, Enphase, Fronius,
Sol-Ark, EG4, and more.

### Batteries

{% warning() %}
If you take one thing away about batteries: lithium batteries used for home
energy storage come in two main chemistries: lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4,
or LFP) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC). LiFePO4 batteries are
**substantially** safer, and you should essentially never install any other
kind of battery for home energy storage.
{% end %}

Batteries, as with inverters, are split into two main categories: DC-coupled
and AC-coupled. We'll go into this in substantially more detail in another
post, but here's a brief overview.

DC-coupled batteries are very similar to the batteries that you're used to (AA
or AAA batteries, or the 12V battery in your vehicle). They have terminals that
you can connect to, and operate at a standard voltage range depending on the
chemistry of the battery. They're connected to an inverter, which draws DC
power from the batteries and converts it into AC power to power your house.
They're charged by an inverter/charger, which, depending on the model and
configuration, can either convert AC power from the grid to DC power to charge
the battery, or convert DC power from the solar panels to DC power to charge
the battery. The standard voltage for household solar batteries is 48V, though
12V batteries are sometimes used for smaller systems, cottages and cabins, etc.

DC-coupled batteries do have downsides, though, the largest of which is that
connecting them to an inverter is more difficult. They tend to require larger,
fine-stranded conductors, separate fuses, and breakers for large DC loads are
either expensive, hard-to-find, or both.

AC-coupled batteries are a bit of a misnomer; the battery is still a DC
battery, but it comes with a built-in inverter/charger that can convert AC
power from the grid to DC power to charge the battery, and vice versa. Perhaps
the most well-known home battery, the Tesla Powerwall, is an AC-coupled
battery. These batteries are typically more expensive than DC-coupled
batteries, less efficient due to the multiple conversions required, and don't
always work with all inverters (e.g. there are tons of reports online of
Enphase microinverters not working with AC-coupled batteries). AC-coupled
batteries are also typically less expandable; the inverter and battery are sold
as a single unit, and you often can't add more batteries to the system without
adding more inverter capabilities, even if all you want to do is increase your
available storage.

Despite what might sound like a number of downsides, AC-coupled batteries are
substantially easier to install, since they're very similar to any other 240V
appliance in your house.

Finally, there are a few other considerations when choosing a battery:
- Lithium batteries cannot be charged below freezing, and can be damaged if
  charged above 45C. If you live in a very cold or very hot climate, you may
  need to pick batteries that include built-in heaters, ensure that they're
  stored in an insulated space, or otherwise protect them from the elements.
- Pay attention to the number of cycles (i.e. one full discharge and charge)
  that the battery is rated for; if you're aiming to cycle the battery every
  day, but it only guarantees 2000 cycles, that's less than 6 years before
  you've exceeded that rating.

### Monitoring

Most solar systems come with some kind of monitoring system, which can be as
basic as "how much power did I produce today", and as complicated as an app
that tells you exactly how much power your house is drawing, lets you configure
charge/discharge percentages, and sometimes even offers per-panel production
statistics. If you're a smart home enthusiast, you may want to look for an
inverter that's compatible with [Solar Assistant](https://solar-assistant.io/),
which is the easiest way to integrate your inverter and/or batteries with a
smart home and Home Assistant.

### Other Components

There are a few other components that you may need to consider, depending on
your installation:

- You'll need some sort of disconnect switch here in Ontario that allows
  disconnecting the solar system from the grid. This is typically a big red
  switch that's mounted on the outside of your house, near the inverter.
- Solar panels are typically mounted on racks raised off the roof by a few
  inches. To prevent birds, squirrels, and other animals from nesting under the
  racks, you should install a "critter guard" around the perimeter of the rack.
  These come in a few different styles, so make sure that you like the look of
  whatever your installer is planning to install.

### Our System

Okay, now that we've covered all the components, what did we actually install?

| Component      | Brand/Model                            | Notes                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Solar Panels   | [Q.PEAK DUO XL-G10.3/BFG 475W][panels] | 26 panels, 12.35kW total     |
| Inverter       | [Sol-Ark 15K][solark]                  | All-in-one inverter          |
| Rapid Shutdown | [Tigo TS4-A-O][tigo]                   | Optimizer and rapid shutdown |
| Batteries      | [Pytes V5º][pytes]                     | 48V, 5kWh, LiFePO4           |
| Roof Mounting  | [Schletter][schletter]                 | Racks and mounts for panels  |
| Roof Anchors   | [Roof Tech RT-MINI][rooftech]          | Mounts rails to roof         |

_(note: we didn't install the batteries as part of the initial solar installation)_

This meets our criteria for a solar installation:
1. Enough panels to cover the entire side of our house that we installed panels on.
2. An all-in-one inverter that:
   1. Can work with any brand of 48V battery.
   1. Worked when the power went out.
   1. Had enough pass-through capability to back up our whole 200A main panel,
      meaning we didn't need to rewire a bunch of circuits to a subpanel.
3. A rapid shutdown system that worked with the Sol-Ark 15k and met ESA's
   requirements.
4. A battery that had the appropriate certifications to be installed in Ontario
   (more on this in a later post), and had built-in heaters so that freezing
   temperatures were not a concern.

### Summary

If all this seems very overwhelming, don't worry–that's what your solar
installer is for. Don't be afraid to ask them questions, check that the system
that they're proposing will actually address your goals, and ask for
references. If you're not sure about something, ask them to explain it to you
in more detail, or ask for a second opinion. A good solar installer will be
happy to explain the details of the system to you, and will be happy to answer
any questions that you have.

## Up Next

In the next part of this series, we'll go into more detail about how our
installation actually went, and the challenges we faced. Stay tuned!

## Appendix A: Wire Sizing and Costs
{% warning() %}
Neither of us is an electrician, so please take this with a grain of salt and
do not use this to design your own system!
{% end %}

{% tip() %}
In the examples below, "A/B" is a shorthand for "A-sized conductors, B of them
in a single cable". So "10/2" means 2 conductors of size 10AWG each in the same
cable assembly. This excludes the ground wire, which is always included but not
counted. So, a standard household power cord would be 14/2 or 12/2, for
example.
{% end %}

Assume you have a 20kW system made up of 40 500W panels in 4 strings of 10
panels each, and thus each string produces about 5000W of power.

For microinverters operating at 240V, that's about 21A of current per string,
and then 84A of current from a combiner box back to the main electrical panel
for your house. To carry 21A of current, you'd need 10AWG wire, and to carry
80A of current, you'd need 4AWG or even 2AWG wire. This is a pretty big wire, and
depending on how long of a run it is between the combiner box and the main
panel, it could add up quickly.

Compare that to a string inverter; say that each 500W panel produces 13A of
current and you want to parallel two of the strings on the roof and bring two
strings down to the inverter as-is (e.g. perhaps your inverter only has 3
inputs, as ours does). For the paralleled strings, you have 26A of current, and
can use 10/2 TECK. For the other two strings, you have 13A of current, and can
use 12/2 TECK, or perhaps even run both inside 12/4 TECK.

As of the time of writing, here's the costs for each of the mentioned types of
cable (TECK90, costs in CAD):

| Cable Type | Cost/m |
|------------|--------|
| 2/2        | $70.38 |
| 4/2        | $29.12 |
| 12/4       | $9.85  |
| 10/2       | $9.20  |
| 12/2       | $6.85  |

You can see how the cost of the wire can add up quickly, especially if you have
a very long run to the main electrical panel.
