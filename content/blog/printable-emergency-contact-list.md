In an emergency, you don't want to have to go hunting for contact information
for insurance or utilities â€“ and you might also not be the one going looking.
An up-to-date emergency contact list is a gesture of kindness towards a very
stressed out version of your future self or potentially a loved one.

We wrote up two formats for this contact list. We put a copy of the longer
detailed version on our fridge as well as in the glovebox of each car, and in
our go bags. The shorter wallet card will fit right in your wallet, perhaps
next to your health card or insurance card. Both are Google Docs - copy them or
download them as Word or OpenDocument files, edit with your information, and
print out as many copies as seems useful.
